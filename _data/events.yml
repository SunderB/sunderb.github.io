    Me and two other people created a banking & budgeting website to help students to manage their money.
    It shows recent transactions, personal account details ans a breakdown chart of your spending by category.
    I worked on the Python back-end helping with interfacing with the Capital One API. I also helped to make the personal details appear on the website, as well as make a somewhat functional email form.
    I also tested SMS messaging using Twilio and wanted to create spending and budget alerts, but we ran out of time to implement this.
    <br><br>
    This was the first in-person hackathon I had attended. I learned that rapidly collaborating as a group on a programming project is difficult without a set plan, having to leave for a chunk of time isn't ideal, and that you should set goals that are achievable during the hackathon.

    I made a <a href="https://sunderb.me/mlh-ghw-share-2022/morse-code">morse code encoder/decoder</a> for one of the challenges. It even converts unicode characters (using an ascii representation of the character code).

    To <em>initialise</em> the new season, I made <a href="https://sunderb.me/mlh-init-2022/mascot-generator.html">a website to predict the next MLH mascot.</a> It had the right options to produce pretty much the right answer!

    For the theme "joined together", I created a simple snowman building game called "Do you want to build a snowman?"
    (great name I know).
    The main concept is to roll snowballs and join them together to create snowmen.
    You can only add a snowball that's smaller than the top snowball of the snowman
    and snowballs get larger as you roll them over snow (like in real life!).
    <br><br>
    I was trying to incorporate these mechanics into a puzzle game where you had to account
    for the size of each snowball to try to assemble the snowman in the correct order.
    I unfortunately ran out of time before being able to design a first level or
    implement any sounds or ui, but I'm happy to have got a working prototype.
    <br><br>
    If I'm bored and have time someday, I might try finishing a first level and see if it's any fun. :P
    <br><br>
    You can play the prototype online and view the submission on <a href="https://sunderb.itch.io/do-you-want-to-build-a-snowman">the game's itch.io page.</a>

    I made a prototype of a community hub website where people could find local news, annoucements, resources and support.
